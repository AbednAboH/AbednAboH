- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AbednAboH
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer graphic ,games and ai. 
- ðŸŒ± I have a Bs.c degree in Computer Science from the university of haifa.
- ðŸ“« you can reach me at abedelrahmanabohussien@gmail.com
- I'm a standup guy that loves to learn new technologies ,loves to debug and understand code in depth before making any adjustments to it. 
- I'm currently searching for a new challenge that would take me to a new level.
- i have done some projects using python , c++,opencv ,JavaScript ,HTML and java ,including a fully autonomus parking lot ,AI labs.
## My AI Based Projects

  ðŸ‘‰ [Co-Evolutionary Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/AbednAboH/CoEvolution-GA-RPS-agents.git) that enhance the performance of RPS strategies by minimizing predictability and maximizing win rates against a variety of opponents.
  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Memetic Algorithm Optimization Project](https://github.com/AbednAboH/Memetic-Algorithm-.git) which implements a Memetic Algorithm (MA) in Python, combining global search strategies of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) with local optimization techniques.
  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Co-Evolutionary Genetic algorithm Based applied to sorting networks](https://github.com/AbednAboH/co-evolutionary-GA-sortingNetworks.git) that evolves efficient sorting networks with minimized comparator usage while simultaneously adapting problem sets to enhance the networks' robustness.

  ðŸ‘‰ [Co-Evolutionary Genetic algorithm on neural networks](https://github.com/AbednAboH/-CoEvolution-GA-Of-NeuralNetworks.git) where the key objective is to train neural networks to classify data effectively while evolving their structure, activation functions, and optimization parameters over generations.
  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Two Flags Game](https://github.com/AbednAboH/Two_Flags_Game.git) : A partial chess game that uses AI technologies to make its moves (this project can be a base for a full chess game)
## Honorable mentions

  ðŸ‘‰ [Privacy Preserving Expectation maximization (PPEM) On Gaussian Mixture models](https://github.com/AbednAboH/ppemAlgorithmPrototype.git) with both an implementation of the approuch and a scientific [article](https://github.com/AbednAboH/ppemAlgorithmPrototype/blob/cb0d04d7f0fa3297f7ba3625c160f12166c552a1/Article/PPEM%20Proposal.pdf) explaining the approuch.

  ðŸ‘‰ [3d Objects Rendering tool](https://github.com/AbednAboH/3D-Computer-Graphics-Software.git) displaying most of the Computer Graphics course material's implementation .

  ðŸ‘‰ [Car lot franchise managment system](https://github.com/AbednAboH/Car-Parking-System.git) a fully working car lot franchise managment system on three fronts; Working force tools (Employees), User interface and Parking lot logistics and availability.
